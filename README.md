# Book My Show - React App

In this project, I tried to create a clone of Book MY Show Website. 
## To run the project you need to install a few libraries

They are:- 
### `npm install react-slick`
### `npm instal slick-carousel`
### `npm install @headlessui/react`
### `npm install react-icons`
### `npm I react-router-dom`
### `npm install -D tailwindcss`
### `npx tailwindcssÂ init`

Then download the node_modules, as I wasn't able to push them on github.

## To run the project 
Use the command 
### `npm start`
